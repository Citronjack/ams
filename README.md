# What dis?

This is the repo for the pyhton code that implements a time discrete event simulator of a single switch. 

# How to run?

Each Part is realized in its specified branch. Run the simstudy file to gain insight into what the system is doing.

# Jupyter Notebooks

I created HTML files of each Jupyter nodebook that answer the Lab questions and give additional information how the system is behaving.
